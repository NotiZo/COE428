I had a lot of difficulties with the garbage and delete methods. The garbage i managed to get working but it still has some flaws like printing out empty spaces ' ' due to my deletion process. My garbage method uses a Depth First Search (DFS) alrgorithm which is basically a stack that pushes in the states and its next states in so long as it reachable. In my delete methods i set them to empty spaces. I couldnt get the conditions right for just 'd' and 'd E'. So instead I made two methods of delete one for each scenario and had the char 'b' represent the one accompanied by a state. I have the same issue i did with the garbage method when deleting all of the states that are unreachable. Other than these methods, the rest work fine.
